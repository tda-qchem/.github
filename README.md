# About

`tda-qchem` is a collection of projects that apply the Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to quantum chemistry (QC):

* https://github.com/tda-qchem/tda-qchem-explorations - is a repository with applications, on which we are currently working,
* https://github.com/tda-qchem/tda-qchem-examples - is a repository with examples that are ready (published)
* https://github.com/tda-qchem/tda-qchem-book-examples - is a placeholder for an official repository that will accompany the book.


# Workflow

We develop examples, ideas in https://github.com/tda-qchem/tda-qchem-explorations. 
Once we publish, the example is copied to https://github.com/tda-qchem/tda-qchem-examples.
Once we decide which examples will be discussed in the book, we move them to an official repository in https://github.com/tda-qchem/tda-qchem-book-examples.
